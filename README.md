# PTWorkOrders
This script was developed to visualize the scheduled maintenance on Pierce Transit bus stops. Through utilization of the code, the work orders could be geospatially displayed for efficient scheduling based on priority and location, rather than by chronologically addressing the work orders based on submitted date.

# Requirements:
Manually downloaded work order report from Pierce Transit's database
Bus stop identification information (publically available from Pierce Transit GeoPortal)
ArcMap or comparable open source mapping software
